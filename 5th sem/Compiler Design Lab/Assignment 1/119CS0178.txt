Q1.
Code :
%{
 #include<stdio.h>
%}
%%
[ \t\n]+ { printf(" "); }
. { printf("%s", yytext); }
%%
int yywrap()
{
 return 1;
}
int main()
{
 
 yylex();
 return 0;
}
Input :
Paragraphs are the group of sentences combined together, about a certain topic.
It is a very important form of writing as we write almost everything in paragraphs, be it an answer, 
essay, story, emails, etc.
We can say that a well-structured paragraph is the essence of good writing. 
The purposes of the paragraph are to give information, to explain something, to tell a story, and to 
convince someone that our idea is right.
Output :
